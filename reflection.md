Reflection:
I chose to work solo on this IDP. For this IDP, I took a tutorial from the coding train on how to code an analog clock, and I took a few elements from this code to create a ditigal clock that expanded on a few ideas from the video. I also showed the exact code in the script.js from the viedo and commented it out to show the ideas I added to my own code. My goal to was to make my own unique twist on the ideas presented in the video, and I think I was able to sucessfully do that by using functions, using loops, adding in shapes, and attempting to use conditionals.
